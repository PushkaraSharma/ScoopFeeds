       " \"Shares of index heavyweight Reliance Industries Limited (RIL) rose nearly 3 per cent on the stock market on Thursday. At around 2:40 am, Reliance shares were trading over 2.9 per cent on the stock market.RIL shares were trading over Rs 2,100 apiece after today’s rally on the stock market. The Reliance boost was one of the key factors that contributed to the S&P BSE Sensex crossing 50,000.The company’s shares rallied today after market regulator Sebi gave conditional approval to Reliance's deal with Kishore Biyani’s Future Group several months after Amazon secured an arbitration order to halt proceedings. The stock was also one of the top gainers in the BSE pack.Based on the Sebi’s approval, the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) also granted a “no adverse observation” report to the deal. But Sebi’s approval to the deal comes with several riders.While Sebi has approved the deal, it has clearly mentioned that the final outcome of the deal will be subject to ongoing arbitration and litigation proceedings. Reacting to the approval, an Amazon spokesperson pointed out that it will continue to legally challenge the deal as the Sebi order has not given a complete green signal to the deal.All you need to know about Reliance-Future deal In August 2020, Reliance Retail Ventures Limited (RRVL) announced a deal to acquire retail, wholesale, logistics and warehousing assets of Future Retail at Rs 24,713 crore. The deal is likely to boost RRVL’s chances of strengthening its position in India’s lucrative retail market.However, Amazon Inc alleged that the Future Group had breached an existing agreement by entering a deal with Reliance. It also got an arbitration order to put the deal on hold.A bitter battle between Amazon and Future Group followed. Amazon wrote several letters to the market regulator and other concerned bodies and even accused Future Group of misleading shareholders. It also approached the Delhi High Court in December 2020, seeking a stay on the Reliance-Future deal.Future Group retaliated to the allegations levelled by Amazon and filed a plea for an interim injunction against Amazon to stop it from wiring to make regular Sebi, CCI and other authorities about the arbitral order against its asset sale. However, the Delhi High Court had rejected the plea.Even though Sebi has approved the much-awaited Reliance-Future deal, the market regulator has mentioned clearly that it will be subject to the outcome of all ongoing legal proceedings in the matter.\",\n",
       " 'With the economic situation in India gradually improving, more companies in the country are hoping to give better salary hikes and bonuses to existing employees besides ramping up hiring activity.While only a few companies handed out bonuses and salary hikes to workers in pandemic-hit 2020, the situation is likely to be better this year, according to a fresh survey quoted in an Economic Times report.At least 60 per cent of the companies who responded to the Michael Page Talent Trends 2021 survey said they are willing to give salary hikes and bonus payouts. Meanwhile, 30 per cent of the surveyed companies are still deciding on whether to give salary hikes and bonuses to employees.The salary trends survey includes responses from 660 companies and 4,600 employees in India. As per the survey, 55 per cent of companies surveyed are planning to give bonuses to their employees; at least 44 per cent want to give more than one month’s salary as a bonus.Salary hike possibilities Higher salary hikes/increments are also on the cards, but it will be different across sectors and companies. Employees in the healthcare and pharma sector can expect the highest salary hike this year at eight per cent, while FMCG employers are planning to give a 7.6 per cent hike.Employees from the e-commerce and internet sector are expected to get a 7.5. per cent hike, which is marginally higher than the 7.3 per cent hike expected for IT professionals. Banking and financial services professionals can expect an average hike of 6.8 per cent, according to the survey.Those engaged in professional services may see a 6.7 per cent hike in salary, while retail sector employees can expect an average hike of 6.1 per cent. Transport and distribution employees may get an average hike of 6 per cent and those involved industrial activities and manufacturing may see a 5.9 per cent average salary hike.Last but not the least, employees working for real estate and construction companies can expect a 5.3 per cent average hike.While top companies are likely to roll out higher salary hikes, small and medium-sized companies that are still struggling may not be able to roll out a salary hike soon.To sum it up, there are high chances that only companies that have performed well during the pandemic or multinational companies may roll out a decent average hike this year. For those working in local companies, the chances of a high salary increment are low.Average hike in 2021An Aon Survey had earlier indicated that the average amount of salary hike Indian companies will give this year is 7.3 per cent, better than the 6.1 per cent in 2020. However, the salary hikes may not be high as over 60 per cent of companies said they will offer salary hikes between five to 10 per cent.The Aon salary trends survey had indicated that Hi-Tech, IT, Information Technology Enabled Services, life sciences, e-commerce, professional services and chemicals are some of the sectors that will see bigger hikes.',\n",
       " 'Benchmark market index, S&P BSE Sensex, on Thursday crossed 50,000 for the first time ever. It took 34 years for the index to reach the milestone figure as Dalal Street continues to beam with optimism.At 11:10 am, Sensex was trading higher by 333.35 points at 50,125.47, while NSE Nifty 50 also touched a fresh record high. The remarkable journey started just around 10 months ago after domestic stock markets plummeted sharply in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic.Checkout the journey of #Sensex as it crosses 50k for the first time #Sensex50k #BSE pic.twitter.com/ZULK533iL8— BSE India (@BSEIndia) January 21, 2021\\nAlthough many investors have asked investors to remain cautious in the days to come, the bulls seem to be in control of market proceedings at the moment.It may be noted that the Sensex was flirting with the 50,000-mark for the last couple of trading sessions, but it finally managed to cross the milestone in the wake of positive global cues. A number of other factors have also helped Sensex scale 50,000. Here are five reasons why:Global equities at record high On Thursday, domestic stock markets got an additional boost from positive global cues after Joe Biden took charge at the US president. Global equity benchmarks hit a record high on Wednesday as investors around the globe expect additional stimulus from the newly inaugurated Joe Biden administration. Last week, the Biden laid out a $1.9 trillion stimulus package proposal to boost the US economy and speed up distribution of coronavirus vaccines in the US.Investors all over the world remain optimistic about the fresh stimulus announcement, leading to a surge in global stocks. This is one of the biggest reasons behind the domestic stock market rally today.Reliance-Future deal approval Reliance was a major contributor to Thursday’s strong market rally that helped Sensex cross the 50,000-mark. Reliance shares are trading almost 3 per cent higher after the market regulator Sebi gave approval to its deal with Future Group to acquire retail assets worth Rs 24,713 crore. While Sebi has laid down some conditions for the deal, Reliance is now one step closer to acquiring the Future’s retail assets — a step that would help it gain a significant advantage over Amazon in the battle for retail dominance in India.Strong domestic rally Over the past few months, domestic stocks have been on a dream run with several stocks from IT, banking and financials domain exceeding expectations on a daily basis. Shares of auto companies have also performed exceptionally well over the last few weeks after a sharp dip last year due to the pandemic. Banking and financial stocks have offered the biggest boost to domestic markets over the last few months. Improvement in economic activity and development on the vaccine front are two key reasons behind the sharp rally in Indian shares.Read | Sensex, Nifty close at record highs: 3 reasons behind stock market optimismPositive corporate earnings While domestic markets had been growing in optimism since last year, Indian shares have got a fresh boost during the third-quarter earnings season. Many companies including major IT firms have posted positive earnings and their valuations have also increased handsomely. Since most firms are expected to perform even better in the next quarter with rising economic activity, they have added a massive boost to the stock market.Budget 2021 optimism The fact that stock markets have touched a record high ahead of the Union Budget 2021 could be due to over-optimistic expectations. Analysts have advised investors to remain cautious. There could be a sharp short-term correction if the expectations of the market are not fulfilled in the upcoming budget. It may be noted that the market is currently trading at surprisingly high valuations and RBI has already flagged a warning about it.',\n",
       " 'The Rs 24,713 crore deal between Reliance Industries Limited (RIL) and Future Retail has been granted conditional approval by market regulator Securities Exchange Board of India (Sebi). The development comes as a blow to Amazon Inc, which had raised an objection when the deal was first announced last year.Based on the Sebi’s approval, the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) has also granted a “no adverse observation” report to the deal. While Sebi has approved the deal, there are some riders included as part of the deal approval.Sebi said the case pending before the Delhi High Court and arbitration proceedings by Amazon, which has been contesting the deal, should be specifically disclosed by Future Group while seeking approval for the scheme of arrangement from shareholders or the NCLT, according to the BSE’s observation latter.The BSE observation letter also stated that Sebi’s go-ahead on the draw scheme of arrangement would be subject to the outcome of the ongoing litigation proceedings.What are Sebi’s conditions? In its approval letter, Sebi has listed a number of conditions, based on objections raised by Amazon Inc.“Company shall ensure that the shares of the transferee entity issued in lieu of the locked-in shares of the transferor entities is subjected to lock-in for the remaining period post scheme,\" Sebi said.It also said that the company (Future Group) “shall ensure that proceedings pending before Sebi against the entities part of the promoter/promoter group or are not directors of the companies involved in the scheme, should be highlighted in the scheme document filed before the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT)”.This means that the shareholders and NCLT have to be provided details of all the complaints by Amazon Inc, submissions by Future Retail Ltd and all other proceedings in the Delhi High Court, Singapore International Arbitration Centre or any other court that has been involved.The market regulator has also said that future disputes, complaints, regulatory actions, proceedings or orders in connection with the scheme should be brought to the notice of shareholders before NCLT approval.Sebi has also asked Future Enterprises Limited to highlight that over 74 per cent of its business value post amalgamation of all the group companies will be transferred to Reliance Retail Ventures Limited (RRVL) and Reliance Retail and Fashion Lifestyle, both of which do not intend to list post the scheme.“It is observed that there are certain ongoing litigations/arbitration/legal proceedings against the draft scheme. In view of the same, the company is advised that these comments of SEBI on the draft scheme of arrangement are subject to the outcome of any of the ongoing litigations/arbitration/legal proceeding involving the draft scheme and/or the decision by any competent authority/competent court in this regard,” stated the BSE observation letter.Commenting on the development, an Amazon spokesperson pointed out that the comments of the market regulator on the proposed deal are subject to the outcome of ongoing arbitration and other legal proceedings. The global e-commerce giant is expected to keep challenging the deal legally.Future-Reliance deal In August 2020, Kishore Biyani’s Future Group had entered a deal with Mukesh Ambani’s Reliance Retail to sell retail, wholesale, logistics and warehousing assets for Rs 24,713 crore.Soon after the deal was announced, Amazon raised an objection to the deal and alleged that Future Group had breached an existing agreement. It managed to temporarily halt the deal after getting an arbitration order against the deal.Since then, Amazon and Future Group have been engaged in a battle of letters. On January 14, 2021, Amazon sent its eighth letter to Sebi and asked the market regulator to suspend its review of the Future-Reliance deal. Amazon highlighted that the matter was still being heard by the Delhi High Court.Besides writing several letters to the market regulator, Amazon had also filed a petition before the Delhi High Court on December 14 last year, seeking a stay on the Reliance-Future deal.The cash-strapped Future Group also retaliated against Amazon with letters to the market regulator. It also filed a plea for an interim injunction against Amazon to restrain it from writing to market regulator Sebi, CCI and other authorities about the arbitral order against its asset sale. The Delhi High Court had declined the request.While Sebi has granted approval to the deal, it has clearly mentioned that the deal will be subject to the outcome of all legal proceedings in the matter.The approval of the deal could be a major boost to Reliance, which is looking to expand its footprint in India’s lucrative retail market. The deal is likely to give Reliance an edge over rivals like Amazon and others that are also trying to expand retail businesses in India.']"

      "WHY DID KAMALA HARRIS CHOOSE TO WEAR PURPLE?CNN's Abby Phillip mentions that there is a special reason behind Kamala Harris opting to wear a purple ensemble for the occasion. Kamala Harris's sartorial choice was perhaps a tribute to Shirley Chisholm, who has also inspired her political career. Shirley was the first Black woman elected to the United States Congress. White, purple and gold are the colours of the US Suffrage party and she may have tried to pay a tribute with her style statement.On CNN, @abbydphillip points out that Kamala Harris is wearing purple, \"a nod to Shirley Chisolm, who ran for president decades ago and inspired her career.\"(Getty Images) pic.twitter.com/Aa7yj0B6ua— philip lewis (@Phil_Lewis_) January 20, 2021\n",
      "Dr Jill Biden, wife of President Joe Biden, choosing to wear a blue outfit also had a hidden message. Jill wore a blue tweed shawl-collar coat by emerging designer Alexandra O’Neill. According to the label, “The colour blue was chosen for the pieces to signify trust, confidence, and stability. The look was carefully crafted by a small team in the heart of New York City’s Garment Center and hand finished by O’Neill in her West Village studio. Alexandra is incredibly humbled to be a small part of such a historic moment.\"ALSO READ | Firecrackers, food and public screening: How Kamala Harris' ancestral village is celebrating todayALSO READ | How Kamala Harris' ancestral village in Tamil Nadu celebrated her oath-taking\n",

This highlight was a work of hairstylist Yene Damtew and was praised by many.

      "Varun Dhawan tested positive for the novel coronavirus in December last year. The actor was shooting for his film, Jug Jugg Jeeyo in Chandigarh with other stars of the film - Neetu Kapoor, Anil Kapoor and Kiara Advani. Along with Varun, Neetu Kapoor tested positive, whereas Anil and Kiara tested negative.After testing positive, the actor went into isolation and took proper precautions too. Now, Varun has tested negative for Covid-19, and he took to Instagram today to reveal the workout routine that helped him recover and get back his stamina. He shared that his trainer made him follow the Animal-Flow workout routine, that made it all possible.WHAT IS ANIMAL FLOW?Varun shared a video of himself doing the Animal-Flow workout with the caption, \"Animal-flow. @ninja.dev has helped me recover and get my stamina back post Covid through animal flow (sic).\"View this post on InstagramA post shared by VarunDhawan (@varundvn)\n",
      "A form of innovative bodyweight movement routine, animal flow combines ground-based movement techniques with elements of various bodyweight training disciplines. These exercises are essentially a series of postures that are linked together in a fluid sequence, seamlessly moving from one position to another.It is a combination of gymnastics, parkour, hand balancing and breakdancing. It is quite similar to yoga poses, but animal flow is more athletic. This creates a challenging workout that helps promote fluid movement in a way that both your hands and feet are touching the floor.The workout routine consists of motions like travelling ape, crocodile rolls and scorpion rolls, hence it is called animal flow, as it imitates the movements made by animals. Varun can also be seen doing a lot of these motions in the video.BENEFITS OF ANIMAL FLOWAnimal flow workout helps increase mobility, flexibility, improve core-stability and muscle endurance. In this exercise pattern, since our limbs are connected to the ground, the body, either moves away from the surface or towards it. This establishes neuromuscular links in our body, and helps in having a good sense of balance and responding to stimuli appropriately.ALSO READ | Salman and Shah Rukh Khan to attend Varun Dhawan and Natasha Dalal's wedding?ALSO READ | Are Varun Dhawan and Natasha Dalal getting married on Jan 24?\n",

We must do better.\"\"We have started by launching investigations into the allegations with the support of specialized external consultants,\" the statement continued. \"Based on the outcomes, we are fully committed to taking any and all appropriate disciplinary action. As these investigations are ongoing, we can\\'t comment further. We are also auditing our existing policies, processes, and systems to understand where these have broken down, and to ensure we can better prevent, detect, and punish inappropriate behaviour.\"Here are the upcoming games of 2020 we really just can\\'t wait for.\\n\\n',\n",
       " '\\nStreamer Dr Disrespect has been permanently banned from Twitch.At the time of writing it\\'s unclear why Dr Disrespect has been removed from the streaming platform, and neither Twitch nor Dr Disrespect – whose real name is Guy Beahm – have responded to requests for clarification.\"As is our process, we take appropriate action when we have evidence that a streamer has acted in violation of our Community Guidelines or Terms of Service,\" a Twitch representative told Polygon. \"These apply to all streamers regardless of status or prominence in the community.\"Twitch would not, however, be drawn on what guidelines Beahm has been found to have breached, but sources reportedly close to the situation have quelled speculation that the action came as a result of DMCA takedowns.\\xa0Prior to his removal, Dr Disrespect had over four million followers on the streaming platform, as well as an exclusivity contract with Twitch. He has yet to formally comment on the decision on any of his social media channels.\\xa0Beahm is no stranger to controversy, of course. As Ford summarised recently, during E3 2019, Beahm had a cameraman following him around, live streaming his experience. He followed him inside the male bathrooms at the event while continuing to stream, which is against convention rules. He was subsequently suspended from Twitch and his E3 badge was revoked. , but two weeks later, his Twitch channel was reinstated.\\xa0In August last year, Musician Jimmy Wong called out Dr DisRespect for being outwardly racist on stream and performing caricatures of Chinese accents.\\xa0As Ford goes on to add, \"the man behind the mask rarely, if ever, shows his true face. He\\'s often talked about thanks to being the subject of plenty of controversies\".There\\'s a lot to get excited about in gaming this year.

       " '\\nBefore COVID-19 caused widespread industry shutdowns in the comic book Direct Market, Marvel Comics announced a new crossover/event storyline embroiling its teen heroes in a controversy not that unfamiliar to the publisher or long-time readers: a newly-minted government agency called CRADLE (Child Hero Reconnaissance and Disruption Law Enforcement) regulating teen superheroes following a tragedy that apparently killed or seriously injured several heroes and civilian students alike.The title of this crossover/event? \\'Outlawed.\\'(Image credit: Marvel Comics)The policy, called \"Kamala\\'s Law\" after Kamala Khan (who protected a high profile activist presumed to be the target of the attack), suffering grievous injuries in the process.The comic that kicked off the initiative – Outlawed #1 – came out March 18, just before the comic book Direct Market went on widespread hiatus; meaning that, while the setup for the story has been in place for several months, we\\'ve barely scratched the surface of the fallout since the intended follow-up comics had their release dates pushed back.(Image credit: Marvel Comics)With its focus on kid and teen heroes, the wider \\'Outlawed\\' event is intended to encompass the ongoing series Miles Morales: Spider-Man and The Magnificent Ms. Marvel as well as three new limited series - Champions, New Warriors, and Power Pack. However, not all of those aspects of the story have come home to roost, as those new series we mentioned are still waiting to be re-scheduled by Marvel. So before Marvel brings \\'Outlawed\\' in full-swing, here\\'s everything you need to know about what happened, and what\\'s in the works.In the previously-released Outlawed #1, Miles Morales and Kamala Khan attend a youth science conference where a young climate activist is scheduled to speak – while the rest of their teen superhero team the Champions surreptitiously keep guard outside the school where the conference is taking place.During the activist\\'s keynote speech, a giant dragon attacks (seemingly at the behest of Roxxon Energy Corporation), attempting to destroy the Champions and the school. The Champions intervene, but things go haywire when Viv Vision phases into the dragon just as Power Man hits it with a fully-charged Chi-strike, resulting in the dragon being defeated - and Viv Vision becoming an apparently infinite conduit for energy that is ravaging the surrounding area.(Image credit: Marvel Comics)Inside the collapsing, critically damaged school, Kamala protects the climate activist from a cave-in, saving her life and becoming critically injured in the process. In the aftermath, the Champions are investigated by a congressional committee who determine that they are the ones primarily responsible for the school\\'s destruction, and ratifying \\'Kamala\\'s Law\\' to restrict teen superhero activity.So far, only one \\'Outlawed\\' tie-in has been released: June 10\\'s Miles Morales: Spider-Man #17. Two other tie-in issues have been solicited – September 2\\'s Miles Morales: Spider-Man #18 and September 9\\'s Magnificent Ms. Marvel #14. Those three spin-offs we mentioned remain unsolicited – but presumably still in the works.(Image credit: Marvel Comics)As for what they\\'ll be, the first planned title is a relaunch of Champions by writer Eve L. Ewing, who wrote Outlawed #1, and artist Simone Di Meo which was originally scheduled for release on April 8. The new volume would have focused on the trio of Miles Morales, Kamala Khan, and Sam Alexander/Nova as the core of a new Champions team operating outside the law.Then there\\'s a relaunched New Warriors limited series by writer Daniel Kibblesmith and artist Luciano Vecchio, which will focus on former New Warriors Justice, Night Thrasher, Namorita, Firestar, Rage, Speedball, and Silhouette training a new team of official recruits with names and powers derived from socially relevant real-world concepts such as Screentime, Snowflake, Safespace, B-Negative, and Trailblazer.(Image credit: Marvel Comics)Finally, the third planned series will be a new Power Pack limited series by writer Ryan North and artist Nico Leon that will follow the Power family as they try to navigate a return to super-heroics in a world where the government regulates teen superheroes.As for when these books will come out? Marvel hasn\\'t offered an updated schedule for \\'Outlawed\\', with updated September solicitations arriving earlier this month. The publisher did not respond to Newsarama’s inquiry earlier this week about the return of these titles and the planned ‘Outlawed’ branding.But given the publisher has implemented a staggered schedule for reprising its releases, so it\\'s likely the new titles – Champions, Power Pack, and New Warriors – will join the already re-solicited Miles Morales: Spider-Man and Magnificent Ms. Marvel in the foreseeable future.\\n\\n',\n",
       " '\\nDC is putting all their marketing marbles in the upcoming Batman event \\'Joker War\\' and it finally kicks off next month on July 21 with Batman #95, written by James Tynion IV and illustrated by Jorge Jimenez and Tomeu Morey.Here\\'s how the publisher is describing the \"final showdown\" between Batman and the Joker.\"It was always going to come to this. The Clown Prince of Crime and the Dark Knight Detective go head-to-head for the last time. The Joker has never wanted to win before, he\\'s never wanted his battle with Batman to end, but now his motivation has shifted. He has decided that one way or another, this will be the final chapter to their story.\"(Image credit: DC)As you can see by preview pages DC has released, they\\'re slipping in a reference to Mark of Zorro, established in Frank Miller\\'s Batman: The Dark Knight Returns #1 as the movie a young Bruce Wayne attended with his parents the night they were murdered in Crime Alley, after decades of retellings of his origin simply referencing an unidentified movie.Miller later corroborated the identity of the film in Batman: Year One and in both instances, it was the 1940 version starring Tyrone Power although subsequently writer Alan Grant referenced the 1920 silent version in Batman #459.The identity of the movie has become official continuity since even if DC hasn\\'t officially pinned down the version.\\'Joker War\\' itself will conclude with Batman #100 in October, which you can bet DC has significant plans to celebrate.\\xa0\"It’s going to be a new status quo,\" Tynion told Newsarama about Batman post-\\'Joker War.\\' \"Let’s put it that way. We’re going to shake things up in Gotham City. Bruce Wayne is going to be upfront and center, but the Gotham City he operates in has changed a lot, and the way he operates as Batman is going to have to change a lot.\"Check out the full preview of Batman #95 below.Image 1 of 8(Image credit: DC)Image 2 of 8(Image credit: DC)Image 3 of 8(Image credit: DC)Image 4 of 8(Image credit: DC)Image 5 of 8(Image credit: DC)Image 6 of 8(Image credit: DC)Image 7 of 8(Image credit: DC)Image 8 of 8(Image credit: DC)\\n\\n',\n",

It will not be a spin-off of the franchise that starred Johnny Depp as Jack Sparrow, but rather a female-fronted original story with brand-new characters under the Pirates franchise umbrella (a Pirate Cinematic Universe, if I may). Jerry Bruckheimer, longtime producer of the Pirates films, is attached to both Elliot's and Robbie's projects.There's nary a whisper on plot or casting aside from Robbie, who will likely take the lead role. Here's hoping she steps into seawater-soaked boots and plays a crass, conniving, absolute drunk of a pirate - less Elizabeth Swann in the first movie and more Barbarossa, please.\\xa0Robbie's Harley Quinn in this year's Birds of Prey is a fantastic blueprint for a swashbuckling lady pirate: a character singularly obsessed with what she considers treasure (in this case, a bodega bacon, egg, and cheese), only willing to help out for as long as it benefits her. Whatever role Robbie plays and how she chooses to play it, this film just got bumped to the top of my list of most anticipated movies.\\xa0Robbie and Hodson didn't just collaborate on Birds of Prey; they also started the Lucky Exports Pitch Program in 2019, which aims to get more female-identifying writers hired to write action movies.

       " '\\nUpdate: The Xbox Lockhart documentation leak has drawn out some new details on what kind of hardware it may include.The leak of documents created for game developers included reference to a Lockhart profiling mode. According to anonymous sources cited by The Verge, this option is included in Xbox Series X developer kits to let creators test their games against the lower-performance specs being targeted for Lockhart.Those specs reportedly include \"7.5GB of usable RAM, a slightly underclocked CPU speed, and around 4 teraflops of GPU performance\", as compared to Xbox Series X\\'s targets for 13.5GB of usable ram and 12 teraflops of GPU performance. Recent rumors indicate that the Xbox Lockhart price could be half that of Xbox Series X, so those reduced hardware capabilities could be accompanied by a significantly smaller hit to your bank account.Those same rumors also point to Xbox Lockhart finally getting its big debut at the Xbox 20/20 event in July, so hopefully we\\'ll have some more solid info about the much-leaked console soon.Original story followsXbox Lockhart has re-surfaced in documentation that solidifies its existence as a complementary console to Xbox Series X.A security researcher who goes by TitleOS on Twitter posted a couple of snippets from the June version of Microsoft\\'s GameCore Development Kit notes, which are available to developers but not typically to the public. The notes mention \"LockhartProfiling modes\" alongside \"AnacondaProfiling\", all as part of the development kit for Project Scarlett.More proof of Lockhart, this time from the XDK/GDK release notes for June 2020. pic.twitter.com/hulDoC9owvJune 24, 2020It\\'s all but confirmed at this point that Anaconda is the internal Microsoft codename for Xbox Series X, while Project Scarlett refers to the company\\'s overarching plans for its next console generation. Lockhart is allegedly a lower-priced alternative to Anaconda/Xbox Series X, with less powerful hardware and no built-in disc drive.TitleOS previously shared some code from the backend of Windows that pointed to Lockhart. Today, they retweeted another dataminer who spotted references to Lockhart in the Xbox One operating system itself.Further mentions for Lockhart are scattered throughout the Xbox One OS - including the development tools and more. Raises interest given @XB1_HexDecimal\\'s information. pic.twitter.com/sLFmp3XTi5June 25, 2020Though Lockhart has been showing up in leaks for quite some time now, Microsoft has still yet to officially confirm it with less than half a year between now and the holiday 2020 launch window for Xbox Series X. Microsoft could always launch the console later down the line, giving Xbox Series X more time to stand on its own.On the other hand, Sony recently revealed that it will launch the PS5 Digital Edition at the same time as its disc-drive-bearing version this year. We\\'ll have to wait and see if that influences Microsoft\\'s overarching plans.See what\\'s on the way in Microsoft\\'s next-generation with our guide to upcoming Xbox Series X games.\\xa0\\n\\n',\n",

The rest will air weekly every Friday.The announcement (which was revealed on \"The Boys F**kin\\' Reunited\" stream involving the entire cast) also included the first three minutes of The Boys season 2. That teaser, which begins at 47:30 in the video above, highlighted a Vought board meeting and was soundtracked to The Rolling Stones\\' \"Sympathy for the Devil.\"Some fans might have been expecting a slightly earlier release date for The Boys season 2, especially if you’ve been following what showrunner Eric Kripke had to say last year.Speaking to Collider Kripke hoped for season 2 to “drop one full year after the first season, so about the same time next year [in July].”Now, it’s going to be September, not July – but that’s perhaps unsurprising given how even post-production is being affected by on the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.Recently, The Boys season 2 has even had all eight of its upcoming episode titles revealed by the Writers Guild of America West website.\"Butcher, Baker, Candlestick Maker\"\"Nothing Like It In The World\"\"Over The Hill With The Swords Of A Thousand Men\"\"Proper Preparation and Planning\"\"The Big Ride\"\"The Bloody Doors Off\"\"We Gotta Go Now\"\"What I Know\"First three minutes?

Jump up to the ledge using the rocks on the right to reach Xur. The snake-faced merchant will stick around until reset time on Tuesday, June 30.\\xa0Here's everything Xur is selling this weekend. Remember that even if you already own all of these Exotics, you can still buy armor again for a better stat roll. That's in addition to Xur's random Exotic engram, which is always worth buying.Exotic weapon - The Colony: fires tiny robot insects that seek out enemies and explode when they get close. The Colony is one of the strangest and most amusing Exotics in Destiny 2, but it's not terribly powerful. It's great fun in PvP since you can basically just shoot all your grenades in the direction of the enemies and watch the kills roll in, but at the same time enemies can avoid your little robots just by jumping. You can't beat the comic relief of a random Colony kill, though.Hunter Exotic - Young Ahamkara's Spine: tripmine grenades last longer and have a larger explosion. Dealing damage with abilities grants tripmine grenade energy. Ahamkara's Spine is basically the tripmine version of Shinobu's Vow, and it comes with the same recommendation: if you really like this grenade type, you'll probably enjoy using this Exotic.Titan Exotic - Synthoceps: increases melee range, and increases melee and super damage while you're surrounded. The Synthoceps are a staple neutral Titan Exotic, especially in PvP, where it can work wonders with abilities like Knockout. Even in PvE, with the right Artifact and Charged with Light mods, Synthoceps can put in some serious work.\\xa0Warlock Exotic - Phoenix Protocol: getting kills and assists inside your Well of Radiance grants super energy. If you're running middle tree solar Warlock in PvE, particularly in raids or dungeons, you probably want to use Phoenix Protocol. It makes Well of Radiance much more powerful and consistent, adding yet more utility to an already powerful support class.\\xa0Here's everything we know about the future of Destiny 2, from a trilogy of expansions to next-gen support. \\xa0\\n\\n\",\n",

On top of being a huggable, super-deformed version of the Mass Effect squadmate who (potentially) cured the Krogan genophage, the plush also sings four different songs when you press his left hand - with batteries included.While Mordin\\'s left hand is used to show off his singing talents, his right hand has a little built-in magnet that can be used to attach an included seashell plush. You know, so he can run tests on it. Sorry, I\\'m not crying as I remember my Mordin\\'s valiant sacrifice, I just have something in my special eyes.According to Sanshee, the Mordin plushes should start shipping out in early August. If you want to give him a little friend, you could also pre-order this adorable little Hanar Hanger Plush that\\'s set to ship a little later. Or you could pretend he\\'s Blasto and recreate your own version of the first hanar Spectre\\'s explosive exploits.Previous Mass Effect plushes from Sanshee include Garrus, who is currently sold out, and Grunt, who is currently on sale for $19.99.
